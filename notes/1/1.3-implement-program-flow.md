# Skill 1.3 - Implement Program Flow

Sequence of instructions
- Has some input
- Produces some output

Working with large datasets/collections
Behavioural change based on data

## Iterating across collections

### `while` loop

```c#
while(true)
{
	//infinite loop
}
```

Tested whether should operate before performing

### `do`...`while`

```c#
do {
	//operation
} while (...)
```
performs once, then tests whether should do again
Can perform multiple set-up, seperate with comma


### `for`
1. Initialisation
2. Test whether should continue
3. Update to be performed

### `foreach`
Iterates over collections
```c#
forech (var item in items) ...
```

Cannot modify iterating value, but if reference, the referenced type can be used.

iterate over `IEnumerble` objects which expose `GetIterator()`
Can be lazy

### `break`
Can end loops early

### `continue`
Ends current pass, and terminating condition tested

## Program decisions
Conditional exeution

### `if`
Logical expression to test whether the block should execute
`else` used to execute if test is false

Can be nested.
`else` not required

### Logical expressions
`<`, `>`, `<=` and `>=`

`==` and `!=`

`&`, `|` and `^`

includes conditional versions `&&` and `||` which only evaluate if required. AKA _short circuiting_

### `switch`
Switches on value, with cases
Not possible to "fall-through"
Is a "luxury" (can be done with `else if`)

## Evaluating Expressions
*Operators* and *operands*

*Operators* specify action to be performed* and are literal, or variables.
*operand* can be *unary* or *monadic*

*Monadic* are prefixed, or postfix. Can also be _binary_ or _ternary_ (`expr ? t : f`)
Context provides implementation, and can be compile time error.

Each operator has precedence, can be forced using parentheses
Also have _associability_ which gives order (l to r) if provided together.
