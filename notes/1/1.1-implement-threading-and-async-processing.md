# 1.1 - Implement threading and async processing

## Task Parallel Library
Task = abstraction of UoW

### `Parallel.Invoke`
Accepts multiple action delegates, creating a task for each
Starts multiple tasks, with no guarantee of execution, or response

### `Parallel.ForEach`
Not completed in same order as invoked

### `Parallel.For`
Goverened by control variable
Init, control, expression. Just like "For" loop

### Managing `Parallel.For` and `Parallel.ForEach`
Optional parameter `ParallelLoopState` in delegate. Can control iteration process
`loopState.Stop()`
Optional return `ParallelLoopResult`. Determines success
:question: No guarantee of stopping
Break guarantees previous have finished

## Parallel LINQ
`AsParallel()`
Determines if appropriate

### Informing
Can chain modifiers
`WithDegreeOfParallelism`
`WithExecutionMode(ParallelExecutionMode.ForceParallelism mode)`

Parallel does not enforce input order
If order is important, `AsOrdered`
Increases query time

:question: If order is to be preserved for execution, use `AsSequential` vs `AsOrdered`

### Iterating
`ForAll` iterates all, and does async as results streaming in
Order not guaranteed

### Exceptions
Catch `AggregateException`

## Tasks
`new Task(...)` Does not start
`Task.Run` Starts

### Return
Uses `TaskFactory.StartNew`
Default scheduler - thread pool
Can provide separate task factory (if required)

### Waiting Completion
`Task.WaitAll` - Exceptions aggregated
`Task.WaitAny`

### Continuation
"Pipeline"
Can specify run conditions (On what result type)

### Child Tasks
Can create task within task, but independent. Detached child
Can specify if attached. `TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent` Can also deny `TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach`
:question: Why/usages?

## Threads and ThreadPool
Task is unit of work. Thread is process running on OS
Might look similar, but quite different

Threads are foreground (but can run in background)
OS will force foreground to completion. i.e: not responding. Tasks always created as background process

Threads have priority, for CPU scheduler. Can be changed in lifetime.

Threads cannot deliver results across each other. Must use shared variables (sync issues)

No continuation. Instead threads can be joined, which pauses one until completion

Not possible to aggregate exceptions. Must be caught and dealt with locally to thread.

### Creating a thread
`new Thread(...)`
`Thread.Start(...)`

### Threads and ThreadStart
Earlier .net required separate method spec, and thread
`new ThreadStart(action)`
`new Thread(threadStart)`

No longer required

### Threads and Lambdas
Can be created with lambda

### Passing data to thread
`ParameterizedThreadStart`
Includes data argument. Can also be argument delegate. Always passed as reference

### Abort
Thread is aborted instantly. Better to use flag (i.e: cancellation variable)

### Thread synchronisation
Join allows two threads to sync
`thread.Join(...)`

### Thread data and ThreadLocal
`[ThreadStatic]`ttribute. Variable created for each thread
`ThreadLocal<T>`
:question: usage?

### Thread execution context
Priority, name, foreground/background, culture, security context
`Thead.CurrentThread`

### Thread Pools
Collection of reusable thread objects
When complete, returns to pool for another process
`QueueUserWorkItem`
:question:`WaitCallback`
State information
Restricts number of active threads, maintaining queue of execution work
Do not use when;
- Large idle thread count -  locks actual work
- Cannot use priority
- All threads have background priority (no UI)
Local state not cleared. Do not use local state variables

### Tasks and UI
Single UI thread -> Events
Use this thread to start background tasks, which in turn release UI thread
Background tasks cannot interface with UI components
Each component has a "Dispatcher" which runs tasks in UI context

### Async Exceptions
Async boid does not throw exceptions - avoid

### `await` parallel tasks
`Task.WhenAll(...)`
`Task.WhenAny(...)`
May not be returned in same order

## Concurrent collections
Thread safety - work correctly when used my mutliple threads
Normal collection types not safe (List, Queue, Dict)
Framework supplies thread safe classes

### :question: `BlockingCollection<T>`
Producer vs Consumer
If both, susceptible to deadlocks
Designed to thread safe way to add/remove

### `ConcurrentQueue<T>`
Enqueue guaranteed
`TryDequeue` may fail
`TryPeek` may fail

### `ConcurrentStack<T>`
`Push` guaranteed
`TryPop`
`PushRange`
`TryPopRange` - number of items

### `ConcurrentBag<T>`
Order not of concern
`Add`
`TryTake`

### `ConcurrentDictionary<T>`
Indexed by key
`TryAdd` - may return false
`TryUpdate`
`AddOrUpdate` - delegate
Updates are atomic
