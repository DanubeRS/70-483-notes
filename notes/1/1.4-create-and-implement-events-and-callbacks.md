# Skill 1.4 - Create and Implement Events and Callbacks
Early programs flowed from beginning to end.
Modern applications, paticularly large ones, have large amounts of interoperating components

## Event Handlers
Before `async` and `await` events were the way to manage async operations
Bound methods to completion triggers, aka _events_
*Publish* and *subscribe* where subscriber only has to know about the mechanism of subscription

### Delegates and Events
Reference to another method in a class

### Action Delegate
`Action` is a method reference with no args, and no result

### Event Subscribers
`+=` is overloaded and used to apply delegate to an event behaviour
Delegates added to published event are called on the same thread
If delegate blocks, the publish is blocked

`GetInvocationList` provides output of all subscribers

`EventRaised?.Invoke()`

### Unsubscribing from a delegate
`-=` used to unsubscribe
If subscriber is added to same publisher multiple times, it will be invoked _n_ times

### Using Events
Delegates can be interfered with by external usages. `event` construction implemented as a data field, rather than property

`public event Action OnEventRaised = delegate {}`

### Create events with built-in delegate types
Events should use `EventHandler` rather than `Action`
This is a part of the .Net pub/sub workflow

`EventHandler` can deliver data, or just signal

Accepts 2 arguments;
1. Reference to raiser (i.e: `this`)
2. Reference to `EventArgs` object which provides event information

### Using `EventArgs` to deliver information
i.e:

```c#
class MyEventArgs : EventArgs {
	public string Property { get; set; }
	
	public MyEventArgs(string property)
	{
		Property = property;
	}
}
```

Now have own type that can describe the event

Define handler as;

`public event EventHandler<MyEventArgs> OnMyEventRaised ...`

Listen:

`static void Listener(object source, AlarmEventArgs args) { ... }`

### Exceptions in event subscribers
What happens if one of the triggered handlers throw an exception?

Each event handler can be called, the subsequently any exceptions are aggregated

```c#
var exceptions = new List<Exception>();

foreach (Delegate handler in OnMyEventRaised.GetInvocationList())
{
	try
	{
		handler.DynamicInvoke(this, new MyEventArgs(...);
	} 
	catch (TargetInvocationException e) 
	{
		exceptions.Add(e);
	}
}

if (exceptions.Any())
{
	throw new AggregateException(exceptions);
}
```

### Create Delegates
DIY Delegates

Declared using `delegate` keyword

i.e:
`delegate int IntOperation(int a, int b);1

can be used the same as any other variable

### `Delegate` vs `delegate`

`delegate` is a keyword used to create delegate type in compilation

`Delegate` is an abstract class used to define the created base types

i.e:
`delegate int IntOperation(...)` will create a type `IntOperation` which implements `Delegate`

### Use lambda expressions (anonymous methods)
Delegates are verbose, and hard to use

Lambdas are more expressive, pure way of doing the same thing

i.e:
`delegate int IntOperation(int a, int b)`

as

`IntOperation op = (a, b) => a + b;`

Can accept multiple inputs, and execute multiple statements

### Closures
Lambda code can access parts of the code around it, which must be available during execution

The compiler makes sure that it is available for use when the delegate is invoked. Extending of lifetime is called *closure*

### Built-in types for use with lambdas
Instead of creating delegate every time;
`delegate int IntOperation(...)`

we can use a built-in type;

`Func<int, int, int> add = (a, b) = a + b`

`Func<T>` and its extensions always return `T`
`Action` does not (i.e: `Action<int, int>` takes 2 numbers, and produces no output`
Also can use `Predicate<TInput>` which always produces a `bool` value (`true` or `false`)

### Anonymous methods
Lambdas can also be used directly in the context they are needed without declaration

i.e:
`Task.Run(() => ...);`
these are *anonymous methods*
