# Skill 1.2 - Manage Multithreading

Asynchronous due to operations not being synchronised
Must be careful to ensure timings of threaded apps donâ€™t affect the app or results
Learn
 -  Sync resource
 - Implement locks
 - Cancel tasks
 - Implement thread safe methods

## Resource Synchronisation
When spread over several asynctasks, becomes increasingly hard to predict sequencing
Race conditions, if the access of a variable is dependant on execution order
## Implement Locking
All about disallowing operations to interrupt each other

### Locks
Atomic actions performed to completion
Access to an atomic action controlled by locking object
Lock forces block to be executed atomically

### Monitors
Ensures only one thread at a time accesses the object
`Monitor.Enter(lockObject)`
**When using monitor, ensure that when exceptions are thrown, locks are released**
Use a try block
```c#
try{
	//code
} finally {
	Monitor.Exit(obj);
}
```

_Why?_

Locks have no way of checking if blokced.

Monitor can do;

`if (Monitor.TryEnter(obj)) ...`

### Deadlocks
When two threads are waiting for each other to finish
Not the same as an infinite loop. Will not use CPU cycles

Ensure that sync objects are never nested.

### The `lock` object
Incorrect usage can introduce deadlocks
Any object managed by reference can be lockable
Scope of object should be restricted
Recommended to explicitly create object for locking
> Not recommended to use a string as a locking object. Strings are pooled, and references used.

### Interlocked Operations
Better way of protecting variable access
`Interlocked` class
Thread safe operations on a variable. Wrapper of sorts
- Increment
- Decrement
- Exchange
- Add

`Interlocked.Add(ref shared, local)`

### Volatile variables
Variable execution may be affected by compiler optimisation
`volatile int x;` tells the compiler not to order optimise

## Cancelling long-running task
Thread abort previously covered, now for `Task`

### Cancellation Token
Threads can be aborted at any time
Task must monitor a cancellation token
`CancellationTokenSource` is the external controller
Allows task to perform any cleanup, and release resources etc

### Raising exception when task cancelled
Useful if started in one place, and monitored in another
```c#
if (ct.IsCancellationRequested) {/* code */}
ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()
```

Beware of using exceptions, as they may bubble up as `AggregateException` outside of dev environments

## Implementing thread-safe methods
Objects expose methods. If used in multi-threaded contexts, it's important they are safe to use.
This means calling from multiple locations concurrently without affecting results

### Thread safety and member variables
Potentially use locking internally

### Thread safety and method parameters
Pass by value are copies
Pass by reference can be changed elsewhere

Objects may be potentially converted to structs (value type) or atomically copy required data
